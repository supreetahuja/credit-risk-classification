    "The primary purpose of this analysis is Risk Assessment and Improving Operational Efficiency:\n",
    "1. Risk Assessment\n",
    "Assessing the risk and predicting the risk associated with loans. In this analysis, we are determining whether a loan is \"healthy\" (likely to be repaid without issues) or \"high-risk\" (higher chances of default payments or problems). This analysis is very valuable for Banks or financial institutions, credit agencies, and private lenders to make informed decisions about lending and managing loan portfolios.\n",
    "2. Operational Efficiency and Data Driven (Credit-Score) decisions\n",
    "This model will help in creating the Automation of loan application process and having the data points clearly showing the Risk's (assessment),this model will make the decsion making faster and efficient. By using this kind of predictive model(s) we can significantly improve operational efficiency for financial institutions. It speeds up the decision-making process and reduces the need for manual or biased decisions whick can result in losses (from default customers) or loss of customers who were rejected loan but were or may be healthy loan bearer's.\n",

    "The model has very high accuracy of 99.18% and it shows a good balance between the Precision and Recall \n",

    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "True Positives (TP): 563 high-risk loans were correctly classified as such.\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): 18,663 healthy loans were correctly classified as such.\n",
    "False Positives (FP): 102 healthy loans were incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): 56 high-risk loans were incorrectly classified as healthy.\n",

    "Precision (P0): The precision for healthy loans is 1.00, which indicates that when the model predicts a loan as healthy (0), \n",

    "\n",
    "Recall '0': The recall for healthy loans is 0.99, suggesting that the model correctly identified 99% of the actual healthy loans. In practical terms, this means the model effectively captures the majority of healthy loans and minimizes false negatives.\n",
